'''in python there are few data types
[1] int is used to store integer numerical values
e.g. amount=900
[2] str is used to store string value
e.g.  name "PIYUSH"
[2] float is used to store decimal value
e.g. percentage 56.90
ABOVE ARE THE MAIN DATA TYPES
TO STORE MULTIPLE VALUE THERE ARE DATA TYPES 
ARRAY DON'T USE DIRECTLY IN PYTHON BECAUSE ARRAY DON"T USE DIFFERENT DATA TYPES LIKE
FRIENDNAME=["RAHUL","ANSHU", 124]
[1]LIST= it can store multiple value with different data types. IT CAN MODIFY TO SAY MUTABLE
e.g.  frienname=["RAHUL","ANSHU" ,123]

[2] TUPLE =IT CAN STORE MULTIPLE VALUES . WE CAN'T MODIFY VALUES TO SAY IMMUTABLE .BUT WE CAN DO INDIRECTLY
WITH TYPECASTING : = CONVERRT ONE DATA TYPE TO ANOTHER DATA TYPE

SET 
DICTIONARY

HOW TO FIND DATA TYPE :  '''
amount=900
#print()=TO READ ANY STATEMENT IN PYTHON
print(amount) #output would be value stored in amount variable
print(type(amount)) # class type int
